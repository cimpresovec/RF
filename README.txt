My personal take on a 'simple' game development framework called RedFramework or short RF.

Uses following libraryes, but are not required:
SDL 1.2.x with OpenGL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
Freetype2 (http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/)
FTGL (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/develop)
GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
Irrklang (http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang)

Please check the Wiki on GitHub for additional info and how to use (in development)
